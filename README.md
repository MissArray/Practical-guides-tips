# Practical-guides-tips
* My collection of practical notes on aspects of JavaScript, Node, CSS, PostgreSQL, ranging from concise examples on repl.it to researched tutorials.
* I put together some of those guides for my mentoring week at Founders & Coders (more on how this works: https://foundersandcoders.com/programme/) and the rest for easy reference.
